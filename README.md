  Also included with the app will be a comprehensive workout builder based on dozens of popular workout program styles and methods giving the user the ability to customize and save personalized workouts for most popular lifting types.
## Who is it for?
  This app is designed for serious weight lifters that enjoy fine-tuning their lifting schedule and also knowing exact percentages for ROM, PRE, MAX Lifts, De-loads as well as wanting to know exact plate combinations for a given lift based on what plates the user has available.
